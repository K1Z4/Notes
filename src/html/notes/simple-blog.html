description: A simpler way to build a static blog
---

<p>Looking at the tech available when building this blog I looked at a quite a few static site building packages. There seemed to be a minefield of trendy JS libraries claiming to be the ultimate solution for static site generation.</p>

<p>Yet I was turned off by all the command line interfaces and the lack of knowledge of whats happening under the hood. It felt like a needless learning curve for a bunch of tech I already know. </p>

<p>Instead of using any of them I went with a custom solution built on top of Gulp. All I wanted was a listing of my blog posts and some simple templating.</p>

<p>To do so I use a few packages to parse the front matter and inject it into my pages using EJS. </p>

<p>All I do to publish a new blog post is create the file and push the commit. In the end I have a timeless build system which integrates perfectly with Netlify for free hosting.</p>
